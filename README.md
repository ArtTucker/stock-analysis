 Stock Analysis with VBA - Module 2

## Overview:

The purpose of the code we prepared during this module - and the code we worked with in this challenge - was to automate an analysis of the performance of various stocks (volume and annual return) for a given year, with the starting data provided. "Our friend Steve" (who really should be paying us for this work), wants to be able to provide his parents with the best information possible on an assortment of "green industry" stocks.

The primary purpose of this end-of-module challenge is to edit or refactor the module's code to make it more efficient, and perhaps more easily understandable. The values we always wish to emulate are that simple, well-documented, and efficient code is the best code. This sacred truth comes second only to the truth that [Hexagons are the Bestagons](https://youtu.be/thOifuHs6eY).

## Results:
/Results: Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.

The output of the end-of-lesson code and the refactored code are essentially the same - as it should be. An analysis of daily trading volumes and annual returns for the selected "green companies" showed that in 2017:
- the ticker with the highest trading volume was SunPower (SPWR);
- the ticker with the best rate of return was Daqo New Energy (DQ);
- most of the stocks performed well, with only two having negative returns.
Meanwhile in 2018:
- the ticker with the highest trading volume was Enphase (ENPH);
- the ticker with the best rate of return was SunRun (RUN);
- most of the stocks preformed poorly, with only two having positive returns.




## Summary:
/Summary: In a summary statement, address the following questions.
What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?
How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
